							<h2>Beginner Operating Systems</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I'd like to Start with <a href="http://linuxmint.com">Linux Mint</a>. Linux Mint is based on a Distro Called Ubuntu, and Linux Mint uses Ubuntu's LTS release as a base. I choose Linux Mint over Ubuntu because it looks a lot Like Windows, which is what most people are using right now. The look and feel makes the transition from Windows to Linux very simple - people who used Windows know where everything is, like the Start Menu and the Taskbar. In addition, Linux Mint has a great and community that can help you if you ever run into issues or if you don't know how to use something. The welcome screen is very helpful in getting you started in the Linux Mint world and the Linux Mint handbooks are extremely helpful for a Linux starter. Linux Mint offers a few variants, Like the XFCE variant for older and less powerful PC's to the Cinnamon edition, which is Linux Mint's flagship Desktop Environment</p>
						<p>If Linux Mint isn't your choice, you might like <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a>. Pop!_OS uses the same Gnome Desktop like Ubuntu, but it uses more of a stock gnome feel to it. Pop!_OS also uses a pretty easy to use installer (In my opinion). The Pop shop has support for native AND flatpak support, so if the application you are looking for isn't in the APT repos, it might be in flatpak. If you've used a Mac before, you might be familiar with the Dock and Top Menu Bar. Pop!_OS is also very customizable thanks to it's GNOME desktop, you can add Dash to Dock to it and it'll become more like a Mac, so Mac Users can feel right at home. In addition, it isn't as bloated as other Distros Like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, it includes far fewer applications, yet people can still get to work right out of the box. Pop!_OS is aimed at professional and creative people, according to their website.</p>
						<hr />
						<h2>More advanced distros...</h2>
						<p>For more advanced Linux users, you should use <a href="http://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a>. Now, you may be saying, "Isn't Ubuntu based on Debian? and isn't Ubuntu a distro for noobs?". Ubuntu is in fact based on debian, but Debian is targeted towards advanced users. Debian has a far more hard to use installer (from the netinstall, anyway). In addition, it uses 3 brances, Stable, testing, and unstable. There are also non-free versions of these editions for proprietary hardware. Overall, Debian is a pretty stable Operating System but the Stable version also has stone-age software (Like kernel 4.19 while the latest kernel is 5.11). </p>
						<p>Now for a very advanced distro that many people use- <a href="http://archlinux.org">Arch Linux.</a> Arch has been known as a very hard to install Operating System, it doesn't even have a Graphical User Interface by default! Arch also has the most packages out of any distro, thanks to the AUR mostly. With Arch, you get to choose everything, package by package. Arch is also a rolling release, which means that there is surely updates every single day. In addition to updates, Arch is also very unstable because of the fast pace packages are given to the end user.
